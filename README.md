# zoomify-for-wordpress
This is my solution to make zoomify running in my blog. I wanted to share it with people who are interested.

Zoomify is an engine to deeply zoom into large pictures without the need to load the whole thing into the browser.
It uses HTML5-Canvas, .js and .css to display only the parts which are neccesary to build the current view.
Here you get zoomify:
https://zoomify.com

add-to-your-function.php
contains functionality to use the zoomify engine with shortcode in your blog.

\zoomify
new folder beyond your child theme folder.
